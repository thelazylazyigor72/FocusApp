# FocusApp
This right here â€” learning frontend project. I've seen a lot of articles that givin' a list of beginners project and some of them were like ToDoList, Timer and Quote Generator, so I've decided to make a little productivity app that combine those 3 mini-apps.

### So what u will see here:
### Desctop app that meant to boost ur productivity w/ ToDoList, PomodoroTimer and QuoteGenerator. 
### Check it here: ----

Also it's important to mention some things: 
- I purposely avided to add responsiveness cuz I think it's unnecessarily within idea of this project, and it's kinda obvious that on mobiles it would be very uncomfortable to use
- I also did very minimalistic design in terms of concept
- All JavaScript code was made by me within a learning process, so yeah, it's probably gonna have a lot of crap.
- It's not a perfect product and honestly it's a lot of stuff to do here, but I think this version still useful it's further functionality and ideas better do w/ some framework, i think.

Techs used here: 
- HTML
- SASS (SCSS)
- JavaScript

Thanks to:

- https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/set/free-svg-backgrounds-and-patterns/ for lettin use their free patterns
- https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable for free and simple quote api

## Quote Generator
---
Basically just fetch request using async/await. 
## ToDo List 
---
What can it do: 
- Create tasks w/ buttons to check/delete that task
- Checked task storing in other list to track ur progress
- When page reload all things stays in those place where they were (LocalStorage API).
- Also u can clear stash of checked tasks

Issues that still there: 
- Due to my localStorage usage it's probably have problem w/ indexin' tasks, so when u check K tasks from N active tasks, at some point checking function will work wrong way. 
## PomodoroTimer
---
What can it do: 
- get users parameters from form and then based on them have 2 buttons and each one of them starts Focusing/Resting timer. 
- Timer is independented from page reloading.
- Also u got pause/stop buttons, back to form button.
